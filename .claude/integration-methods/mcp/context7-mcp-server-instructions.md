# Context7 MCP Server Instructions

## File Location Update
**Current Path**: `/home/ec-xps/EC-Development/.claude/integration-methods/mcp/context7-mcp-server-instructions.md`  
**Previous Paths**: 
- `/home/ec-xps/EC-Development/.claude/mcp/context7-mcp-server-instructions.md` (July 11, 2025)
- `/home/ec-xps/EC-Development/MCP/context7-mcp-server-instructions.md` (Original)

**Final Migration Date**: July 11, 2025  
**Reason**: Organized under standard "integration-methods" terminology for Claude-specific integration configurations

## Overview
Context7 is an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that provides up-to-date documentation for LLMs and AI code editors. It's developed by Upstash and available at https://context7.com.

## Installation Methods Found

### Current Installation in Claude Code (VERIFIED)
Context7 is **actively installed and running** in this Claude Code session with the following configuration:

**Current Status:**
- **Package**: `@upstash/context7-mcp@v1.0.14` (installed globally)
- **Binary Path**: `/home/ec-xps/.nvm/versions/node/v22.16.0/bin/context7-mcp`
- **Process**: Running as PID 2321
- **Status**: âœ… Active and working

**Installation Commands Used:**
```bash
# 1. Global NPM installation
npm install -g @upstash/context7-mcp@latest

# 2. Add to Claude Code MCP configuration
claude mcp add context7 context7-mcp
```

**Current Claude Code Configuration (Post-Conversion):**
```json
"context7": {
  "command": "npx",
  "args": ["-y", "@upstash/context7-mcp"]
}
```

**Previous Configuration (Before July 11, 2025):**
```json
"context7": {
  "command": "context7-mcp"
}
```

**Previous Method**: Context7 previously used a **direct global binary** (`context7-mcp`) but has been **converted to NPX method** for standardization (July 11, 2025).

## Installation Method Impact

### Does Installation Method Matter for Usage?
**Short Answer**: No, it doesn't impact how you use Context7 day-to-day.

### What's the Same Regardless of Installation:
- **Usage Commands**: You still use `use context7` in prompts exactly the same way
- **Features**: All Context7 functionality works identically  
- **Results**: Documentation lookup works the same regardless of installation method
- **Performance**: Both methods provide the same user experience

### What's Different (Technical Only):
| Aspect | Direct Binary (Current) | NPX Method (Official) |
|--------|------------------------|----------------------|
| **Startup Speed** | Slightly faster | Slightly slower (NPX wrapper) |
| **Update Command** | `npm update -g @upstash/context7-mcp` | Reinstall via NPX |
| **Troubleshooting** | Check global binary | Check NPX access |
| **Maintenance** | `claude mcp remove/add context7` | Modify JSON config |

### When Installation Method Matters:
1. **Troubleshooting**: Different methods require different debugging approaches
2. **Updates**: Different commands to update the package
3. **Team Setup**: Documenting setup for others
4. **Support**: Following official docs vs actual configuration

### Bottom Line:
For daily Context7 usage, the installation method makes **zero difference**. You use Context7 exactly the same way. The installation method only becomes relevant for maintenance, troubleshooting, or helping others set up Context7.

### Installation Requirements
- **Node.js**: â‰¥ v18.0.0
- **Compatible MCP Client**: Claude Desktop, Cursor, Windsurf, VS Code, etc.

## NPX Environment and Standardization

### NPX Location in WSL2
**NPX runs in WSL2 environment**, not Windows NPX. Based on the MCP configuration:

- **Environment**: WSL2 Ubuntu 22.04
- **Node.js Path**: `/home/ec-xps/.nvm/versions/node/v22.17.0/bin/`
- **NPX Location**: WSL2 filesystem (Linux environment)
- **Execution Context**: All MCP servers execute in WSL2, not Windows

### Standardization Analysis (Updated July 11, 2025)
All configured MCP servers now use **NPX for complete consistency**:

| Server | Current Method (After Conversion) | Standard Pattern |
|--------|----------------------------------|------------------|
| dart | `npx -y dart-mcp-server` | âœ… NPX (Standard) |
| **context7** | `npx -y @upstash/context7-mcp` | âœ… NPX (Standard) âœ¨ |
| playwright | `npx @playwright/mcp` | âœ… NPX (Standard) |
| supabase | `npx -y @supabase/mcp-server-supabase@latest` | âœ… NPX (Standard) |
| desktop-commander | `npx -y @wonderwhy-er/desktop-commander` | âœ… NPX (Standard) |

**Conclusion**: âœ… **Complete standardization achieved** - all MCP servers now use NPX method consistently.

### Why Context7 Previously Used Direct Binary (Historical)
**Previous Installation Pattern (Before July 11, 2025)**:
1. Context7 was installed with global NPM: `npm install -g @upstash/context7-mcp@latest`
2. Then added as direct binary: `claude mcp add context7 context7-mcp`
3. This created the direct binary configuration instead of NPX

**This happened because:**
- Global installation creates binary in PATH
- `claude mcp add` uses the binary name directly
- Other servers use `npx` wrapper for consistency

**Conversion completed July 11, 2025** to achieve full standardization.

## MCP Server Configuration

### Previous Configuration (Historical - Before July 11, 2025)
**Previous method** (direct binary):

```bash
# Install globally
npm install -g @upstash/context7-mcp@latest

# Add to Claude Code (created direct binary config)
claude mcp add context7 context7-mcp
```

Previous result:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "context7": {
      "command": "context7-mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

### Standardization Conversion Process (COMPLETED)
**Date**: July 11, 2025  
**Status**: âœ… Successfully converted to NPX method  
**Requested by**: ec-xps for MCP server standardization

**Conversion Steps Performed**:
```bash
# Step 1: Remove current non-standard configuration
claude mcp remove context7

# Step 2: Add using standardized NPX method  
claude mcp add-json context7 '{"command":"npx","args":["-y","@upstash/context7-mcp"]}'

# Step 3: Verify conversion worked
claude mcp list  # Confirm context7 now uses NPX method
```

**Result After Conversion**:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "context7": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@upstash/context7-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Verification**:
- âœ… Context7 now matches **official Context7 documentation** NPX pattern exactly
- âœ… **Official Configuration**: `"command": "npx", "args": ["-y", "@upstash/context7-mcp"]`
- âœ… **Our Configuration**: `"command": "npx", "args": ["-y", "@upstash/context7-mcp"]` 
- âœ… **Perfect Match**: 100% alignment with Context7 official documentation
- âœ… Consistent with all other MCP servers (dart, playwright, supabase, desktop-commander)
- âœ… Context7 functionality remains unchanged for end users
- âœ… Documentation lookup works identically ("use context7" commands)

**Official Documentation Compliance**:
According to the official Context7 GitHub repository (https://github.com/upstash/context7), the recommended configuration is **exactly** what we implemented:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "context7": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@upstash/context7-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Result**: âœ… **Perfect compliance** with official Context7 documentation AND internal standardization achieved.
